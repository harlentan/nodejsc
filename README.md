nodejs for JavaScriptCore javascript


==Intention    
The intent of this nodejsc project is to support the WebKit of Apple in using nodejs, which use the JavaScriptCore as its javascript engine. So I started this project in 2012. But we find that nodejsc can be used in my team. um...I am sorry, I just deleted this project and create a empty project here. After that,  I will  contribute to Joyent nodejs.
